## Project Description
Creating machine learning models often involves writing redundant code, particularly when tuning hyperparameters and comparing performance across different models. This project aims to reduce that redundancy by streamlining these repetitive steps, making the model development process more efficient and time-effective. To achieve this, our project focuses on building reusable functions that, given user input, automatically return the optimal hyperparameters, the best-performing model, its accuracy score, and a corresponding confusion matrix—all in a single, unified workflow.
